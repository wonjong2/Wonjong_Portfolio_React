-   WHEN I view the header,
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

-   WHEN I view the navigation titles,
    THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

-   WHEN I click on a navigation title,
